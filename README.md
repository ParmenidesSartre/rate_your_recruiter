     cd rate_your_recruiter
     ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   - Before installing dependencies, set up a virtual environment to manage them locally for the project. If you do not have virtualenv installed, you can install it using pip:

4. **Database Setup**

   - This application uses SQLite for development. Initialize the database with the following command:
     ```
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

5. **Create an Admin User**

   - To access the Django Admin panel, create a superuser:
     ```
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

6. **Run Development Server**
   - Start the Django development server:
     ```
